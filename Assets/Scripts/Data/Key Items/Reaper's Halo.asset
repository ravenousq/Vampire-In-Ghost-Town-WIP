  itemDescription: "Resembles a crown of thorns with sharp blades sticking out of
    it. Especially cruel weaponry, even for the standards of The Evangelists. This
    particular Halo is covered in blood clots which suggest it being put to good
    use already. \n\nCan be thrown in any direction. Bounces off of walls and cuts
    through everything on it\u2019s path."
