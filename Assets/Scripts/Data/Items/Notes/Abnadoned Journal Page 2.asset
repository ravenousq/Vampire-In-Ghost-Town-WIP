  itemDescription: A singular page torn off a notebook seemingly in haste. The handwriting
    seems quite sophisticated heeding the sorry state of this crumpled piece of paper.
  noteContent: \tI think we might be lost in the forest. Our Reverend says outherwise,
    yet my faith remains frail. I trust The Maker to guide us, yet there is something
    strange about Deadwood. An eerie energy fills the space and there is a constant
    metalic taste floating in the air.\n\tI should stop thinking about what I am
    not supposed to, yet last events that occured in town troublesmy soul. Moods
    amongst my comerades also appear to be questionable, but they will not admit
    the truth, nor will I.\n\tOnly Sister Amelia appears to ramain optimistic in
    these dark times. It is strange as we are supposed to serve the lower hierarchy
    of The Church, yet today she is the one preaching at the campfire. I hope that
    she is not mesmerising us, so that we do not notice her true intentions.
