  itemDescription: A singular page torn off a notebook seemingly in haste. The handwriting
    seems quite sophisticated heeding the sorry state of this crumpled piece of paper.
  noteContent: \tI will probably die here. I am reconciled with my fate. I still
    pray. I still sing to my Lord.\n\tThis strange aura. It was not only in my head.
    The stone. They were right. About the stone. They changed.\n\tI hope... *part
    unreadable* ... is secured.\n\tMaggots. In. My. Eyes. I. Can. See. Everything.
    *rest of the page is covered in the last paragraphed scribbled in less and less
    readable handwriting*
