  itemDescription: A singular page torn off a notebook seemingly in haste. The handwriting
    seems quite sophisticated heeding the sorry state of this crumpled piece of paper.
  noteContent: \tWe heard screams comming from where the scouting party ventured.
    It happened just moments ago and now chaos broke into our numbers. The Reverend
    exhorts everyone to calm their spirits, but even we feel uneasy, let alone the
    dwellers.\n\tMy head spins rapidly, my... *part unreadable* ...whatever it takes
    to serve The Maker.\n\tBlood chilling shrieks and howls... *part unreadable*
    ...but I will not bend and loose my mind like the others.
