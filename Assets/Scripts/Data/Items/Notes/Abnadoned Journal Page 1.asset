  itemDescription: A singular page torn off a notebook seemingly in haste. The handwriting
    seems quite sophisticated heeding the sorry state of this crumpled piece of paper.
  noteContent: \tToday we arrived at the spot where woods meet desert sands. Aside
    from Sister Amelia's testimony we have no real track to follow, but I believe
    her to be pious enough to not pervaricate, even in such a matter.\n\t I would
    still rather her to not acompany us not only due to her safety, but also beacuse
    she might want to save this beast's pathetic life. We will not allow it. Such
    sort must witness absolution through perishing. Burn.\n\t Let us hope we will
    have a good hunt tomorrow.
